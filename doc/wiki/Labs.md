## Lab northwind

In this laboratory we will see:

Creating the northwind sample database tables and loading it with sample data. This database presents several non-standard cases such as: - Name of tables and fields with spaces - Tables with composite primary keys - Tables with auto-numeric ids and others with ids strings

Since this is the database that was used for many examples and unit tests, you can test the example queries that are in the documentation. We will also see some example queries to execute from CLI
